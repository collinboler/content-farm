3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,330
influencer.

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,534
If you pick

5
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:07,926
Charlie

6
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:08,590
D'Amelio,

7
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,750
you've failed.

8
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,678
Say the same

9
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:11,070
and you're

10
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,486
done. Only the

11
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:13,766
top 1% can get.

12
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:14,550
All right.

13
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,810
Question two.

14
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,886
Press and hold

15
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:17,342

00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:17,886
button and

17
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:18,478
select one of

18
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:18,854
the four

19
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:19,730
emojis.

20
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,830
You definitely

21
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,430
chose this

22
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,486
specific emoji.

23
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:27,134
Bye bye.

24
00:00:27,182 --> 00:00:28,344
Question three.

25
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:29,036
Name a

historical

27
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:30,120
event,

28
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,556
only a beta,

29
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:35,956
like you

30
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:36,516
picked. Moon

31
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:37,324
landing.

32
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:38,668
You've failed.

33
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:39,920
Question four.

34
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,964
Pick a number

35
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:41,700
between three

36
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,560
and eleven.

37
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,116
I already know

38
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:48,660
you went with

39
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,804
seven. Get out.

40
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:51,080
Question five,

41
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,180
who appears

42
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,764
when you click

43
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:53,276
share. And

44
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:53,880
more.

45
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,306
Only a beta,

46
00:00:59,338 --> 00:00:59,962
like you picked

47
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:00,442
your coach.

48
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:01,962
Bye bye. If you

49
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:02,658
get this last

50
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:03,154
one right,

51
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:03,426
you're

52
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:04,590
officially him.

53
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,110
Question six.

54
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,466
Choose Coke or

55
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:08,310
Pepsi.

56
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,666
I already know

57
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,186
you went with

58
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:15,386
coke. You're

59
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:16,082
not as cheeky

60
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:16,698
as you think.
