1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,862
Name a social

2
00:00:00,926 --> 00:00:01,270
media

3
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,798
influencer if

4
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:07,462
you decided to

5
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:08,166
go with Charli

6
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:09,118
D'Amelio.

7
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:09,966
You're not as

8
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:10,686
cheeky as you

9
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:11,982
think. Say the

10
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:12,606
same and it's

11
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,558
game over.

12
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:14,550
Only a true

13
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,454
alpha gets all

14
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:16,462
six, right.

15
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:17,770
Question two.

16
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,886
Press and hold

17
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:19,406
the comment

18
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:19,990
button and

19
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,598
select one of

20
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:20,974
the four

21
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:21,890
emojis.

22
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,336
Only a beta

23
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:28,032
like you picked

24
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:28,688
this specific

25
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:30,152
emoji. You're

26
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:30,872
not as cheeky

27
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:31,808
as you think.

28
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:33,140
Question three

29
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,520
name a type of

30
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,712
tree I

31
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:40,296
already know

32
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:40,792
you went with

33
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:41,936
oak. You're

34
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:43,176
out. Question

35
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:44,672
four. Pick a

36
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:45,304
color that's a

37
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,300
shade of white

38
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,746
I already know

39
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:52,266
you went with

40
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:53,522
Pearl. You're

41
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:54,242
not as cheeky

42
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:55,242
as you think.

43
00:00:55,426 --> 00:00:56,590
Question five,

44
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,666
who appears

45
00:00:57,698 --> 00:00:58,298
when you click

46
00:00:58,354 --> 00:00:59,590
share. And more

47
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:04,930
if you decided

48
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,562
to go with your

49
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:06,314
grandpa. Keep

50
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:07,186
scrolling

51
00:01:07,378 --> 00:01:07,986
because you're

52
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:09,346
out. I bet you

53
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:10,482
1000 Roebucks

54
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:11,050
you'll get this

55
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,898
one wrong.

56
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:13,346
Question six

57
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:14,386
choose hot or

58
00:01:14,418 --> 00:01:15,110
cold.

59
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,500
You definitely

60
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,988
chose hot. You

61
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:22,412
need to get

62
00:01:22,436 --> 00:01:22,940
your game up.
