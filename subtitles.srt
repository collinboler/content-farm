football team

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,422
if you picked

5
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:08,246
Buffalo Bill's.

6
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:09,574
Adios, amigo.

7
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:10,590
Don't match my

8
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,118
choice or

9
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:11,982
you're out.

10
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,566
Only 1% can get

11
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:14,758
all six right.

12
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:16,050
Question two.

13
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,126
Press and hold

14
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:17,622
the comment

15
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:18,166
button and

16
00:00:18,198 --> 00:00:18,758
select one of

17
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:19,110
the four

18
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,010
emojis.

19
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,486
I already know

20
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:26,022
you went with

21
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:26,702
this specific

22
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:27,510
emoji. You've

23
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,246
lost. Question

24
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:29,782
three. Name a

25
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:30,690
constellation.

26
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,206
If your answer

27
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:37,130
was Orion,

28
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,126
you're not as

29
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:38,846
cheeky as you

30
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:39,526
think.

31
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:40,850
Question four.

32
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,934
Pick a number

33
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:43,278
between 60 and

34
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:43,930
70.

35
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,550
I already know

36
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,110
you went with

37
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,094
64. Keep

38
00:00:51,142 --> 00:00:51,742
scrolling

39
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:52,366
because you're

40
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:53,550
out. Question

41
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,816
five. Who

42
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:55,368
appears when

43
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:55,784
you click

44
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:56,256
share. And

45
00:00:56,288 --> 00:00:56,860
more.

46
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,152
You better not

47
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:02,656
have chosen

48
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,544
your uncle.

49
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:05,152
You're out. If

50
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:05,736
you can't get

51
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:06,248
this last

52
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
question right,

53
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:08,248
you owe me a

54
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:08,820
follow.

55
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,300
Question six.

56
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,896
Choose Xbox of

57
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:12,780
PlayStation.

58
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,376
I just know you

59
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:18,616
picked

60
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:19,616
PlayStation.

61
00:01:19,808 --> 00:01:20,472
You're not as

62
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:21,112
cheeky as you

63
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:21,368
think.
