8
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:11,046
you. Say the

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,726
same as me and

10
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,558
you're out.

11
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:14,766
Only 1.25% can

12
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,718

19
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:20,914
emojis.

20
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:26,218
If you chose

21
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:26,874
this one, you

22
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:27,634
failed.

23
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:28,894

29
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:38,626
need to get

30
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,674
your game up.

31
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:40,934

35
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:48,922
You better not

36
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:49,522
have chosen

37
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:50,274

more.

44
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,670
If your answer

45
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:01,030
was your

46
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:01,814
therapist, you

47
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,246
failed. If you

48
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,902
get this last

49
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:04,518

You definitely

56
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:16,926
chose fiction.

57
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,470
You're

58
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:18,102
