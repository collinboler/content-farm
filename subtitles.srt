Name a popular

2
00:00:01,142 --> 00:00:02,050
mobile game.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,350
If your answer

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:07,910
was candy

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,294
crush, keep

6
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,126
scrolling

7
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:10,926
because you're

8
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,206
out. Say the

9
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:12,870
same and you're

10
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,246
done. Only the

11
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:15,542
top 1% can get.

12
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:16,334
All right.

13
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:17,610
Question two

14
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,686
press and hold

15
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:19,142

button and

17
00:00:19,718 --> 00:00:20,294
select one of

18
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:20,654
the four

19
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:21,570
emojis.

20
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,016
I just know you

21
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:27,464
picked this

22
00:00:27,512 --> 00:00:28,848
specific emoji.

23
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:29,336
You're

24
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:29,928
officially a

25
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:30,624
beta. Question

26
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:32,168
three name a

27
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:32,512
piece of

28
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:33,300
furniture.

29
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,696
Only a beta,

30
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:39,376
like you picked

31
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:40,016
sofa. You're

32
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:41,376
done. Question

33
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:42,872
four pick a

34
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:43,480
number between

35
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,980
91 hundred.

36
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,416
If your answer

37
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:51,512
was 94, you're

38
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:52,232
not as cheeky

39
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:53,208
as you think.

40
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:54,552
Question five

41
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:55,456
who appears

42
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,024
when you click

43
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:56,576
share? And

44
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:57,180
more.

45
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,616
I just know you

46
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:03,016
picked your

47
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:04,416
mentor. It's

48
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:05,464
over for you.

49
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:06,288
This last

50
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:06,936
question is

51
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:07,780
impossible.

52
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,300
Question six

53
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,640
choose sunrise

54
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,780
or sunset.

55
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,064
If you picked

56
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:17,856
sunset, you've
