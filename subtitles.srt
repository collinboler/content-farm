00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,894
Name a hit song

2
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,474
from the 2020s.

3
00:00:06,454 --> 00:00:07,230
Only a beta

4
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:07,934
like you picked

5
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:08,374
blinding

6
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:09,534
lights. It's

7
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:10,526
over for you.

8
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,382
Say the same

9
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:12,022
and it's game

10
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,406
over. Only a

11
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,350
true alpha gets

12
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:15,558
all six right.

13
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:16,874
Question two.

14
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:17,910
Press and hold

15
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:18,406

16
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,950
button and

17
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:19,598
select one of

18
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:19,958
the four

19
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:20,834
emojis.

20
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:26,178
If you decided

21
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:26,914
to go with this

22
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:28,226
one, you're not

23
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:28,906
as cheeky as

24
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,698
you think.

25
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,014
Question three,

26
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:32,290
name a type of

27
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:32,934
weather.

28
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:38,194
If you chose

29
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:38,794
rainy, you're

30
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:40,130
done. Question

31
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:41,650
four pick a

32
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:42,298
number between

33
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:43,494
seven and 14.

34
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:48,746
Only a beta

35
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,434
like you picked

36
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:50,730
nine. You've

37
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:51,450
lost. Question

38
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:52,750
five, who

39
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:53,342
appears when

40
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:53,734
you click

41
00:00:53,774 --> 00:00:54,270
share. And

42
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:54,874
more.

43
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:00,286
I already know

44
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,814
you went with

45
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:01,374
someone whose

46
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:01,950
name starts

47
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:02,670
with b. You're

48
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:03,966
done. If you

49
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,614
can't get this

50
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:05,270
last question

51
00:01:05,342 --> 00:01:06,646
right, you owe

52
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,474
me a follow.

53
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,034
Question six

54
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:10,534
choose city or

55
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:11,434
countryside.

56
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:16,886
I already know

57
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,366
you went with

58
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:17,918
city. Keep

59
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:18,694
scrolling

60
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:19,430
because you're
