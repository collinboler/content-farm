1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,800
Name a famous

2
00:00:00,854 --> 00:00:01,650
athlete.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,526
Only a beta, like

4
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:07,438
you picked LeBron

5
00:00:07,494 --> 00:00:09,086
James. You're not as

6
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:10,486
cheeky as you think.

7
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:11,614
Make sure to choose

8
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:12,502
differently or

9
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:13,950
you're done. Only

10
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,526
the top 2% get. All

11
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,410
right. Question two.

12
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,726
Press and hold the

13
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:19,566
comment button and

14
00:00:19,598 --> 00:00:20,302
select one of the

15
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:21,410
four emojis.

16
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,102
If you decided to go

17
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,150
with this one, it's

18
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,214
over for you.

19
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:31,262
Question three pick

20
00:00:31,286 --> 00:00:32,450
a type of dance.

21
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,686
If your answer was

22
00:00:38,718 --> 00:00:40,526
salsa, adios,

23
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:42,142
amigo. Question

24
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:43,814
four. Pick a number

25
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:44,806
between four and

26
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:45,410
ten.

27
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,542
I already know you

28
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:51,584
went with five.

29
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:52,564
You've failed.

30
00:00:52,612 --> 00:00:54,252
Question five. Who

31
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:55,012
appears when you

32
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:55,756
click share? And

33
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:56,360
more.

34
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,932
I already know you

35
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:02,436
went with your

36
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:03,220
tailor. It's over

37
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,732
for you. No one has

38
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:05,644
ever gotten this far

39
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:07,196
before. Question six

40
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:08,556
choose Xbox of

41
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:09,440
PlayStation.

42
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,820
If your answer was

43
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,716
PlayStation, you're

44
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:16,300
too predictable.
